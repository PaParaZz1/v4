DI-engine is a general decision intelligence engine for PyTorch.
It provides python-first and asynchronous-native task and middleware abstractions, and modularly integrates several applications. Based on the above mechanisms, it supports 120+ various deep RL algorithms with superior performance, high efficiency, well-organized documentation and unittest.
