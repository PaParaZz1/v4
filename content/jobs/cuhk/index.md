- Pioneer a series of general and efficient MCTS-based RL algorithms (LightZero → UniZero → ScaleZero) that integrate world-model planning with multi-task RL optimization to build foundational models for decision-making AI.
- Advance the efficiency and reliability of Reinforcement Learning in gaming, with expertise in multi-agent and offline RL.
- Explore novel multi-modal interactions paradigm with post-training techniques, including image metaphor (e.g., meme) generation, GUI agents, and speech/singing voice synthesis.
